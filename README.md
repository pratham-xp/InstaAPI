# InstaClone

In this project, I've created an API which demonstrates few backend functionalities of Instagram.
The API is built using GO prgramming Language and for database I've used MongoDB

The API is capable of following operations:
1-> Create an user
2-> Get user info from user id
3-> Create a post
4-> Get a post using id

User structure has following attributes:
1-> Id
2-> Name
3-> Email
4-> Password

Post structure has following attributes:
1-> Id
2-> Caption
3-> Image URL
4-> Posted Timestamp
